# OpenCloudOS Documentation

Welcome to the OpenCloudOS Documentation!

OpenCloudOS is an operating system community project jointly initiated by more than 20 manufacturers and individuals from operating systems, cloud platforms, software and hardware. It will soon enter the incubating stage of the OpenAtom Foundation. The goal of OpenClouOS is to construct a comprehensive neutral, open, secure, stable, easy-to-use, high-performance Linux-based server operating system. It creates an operating system open-source technology community, expands the influence of community distributions, and builds a healthy and prosperous operating system ecosystem.
